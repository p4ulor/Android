# What is the paradigm of the Kotlin language?

Kotlin is a statically typed, cross-platform language that doesn't impose a specific programming paradigm. 

This means it supports various styles of programming. In particular, Kotlin enables developers to write code in **both the object-oriented and functional programming** styles. 

This provides programmers with the flexibility to choose the approach that best suits their problem-solving needs, contributing to Kotlin's popularity and wide-spread use. This versatility and its interoperability with Java have made Kotlin a favored choice for many developers, especially in Android app development.
