## When to Use Multiple Activities:
- **Distinct Screens:** If your application has screens that are largely independent, with minimal shared data or UI components, using separate activities can be appropriate. Each activity manages its own lifecycle and can operate independently.

## When to Use a Single Activity with Multiple Fragments:
- **Shared UI Components:** For applications with screens that share common UI elements or need to display multiple views simultaneously (e.g., a tablet layout with a list and detail view side by side), fragments offer a modular approach.
- **Dynamic UI Changes:** If your app requires dynamic changes within the same screen, such as swapping different views without navigating away, fragments allow for this flexibility within a single activity.

**Why Google Introduced Fragments:**

Google introduced fragments to enhance modularity and reusability in Android applications. Fragments allow developers to create UI components that can be combined within activities, facilitating flexible UI designs, especially for devices with larger screens like tablets.

**Advantages of Using Fragments:**
- **Modularity:** Fragments enable the creation of reusable components, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Flexible UI Design:** They support dynamic and adaptable UI layouts, accommodating various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Simplified Communication:** Fragments within the same activity can communicate more efficiently, sharing data and UI elements seamlessly.

**Disadvantages of Using Fragments:**
- **Increased Complexity:** Managing the fragment lifecycle alongside the activity lifecycle can be complex, requiring careful handling to avoid issues.
- **Navigation Challenges:** Implementing navigation between fragments may require additional effort, especially when handling the back stack and ensuring a consistent user experience.
